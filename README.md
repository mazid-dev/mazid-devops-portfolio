## ⚙️ CI/CD Process (Netlify)

> I’ve connected this repo to Netlify so that **every push to the `main` branch automatically deploys** my updated portfolio website.

**How it works:**

1. GitHub repo connected to Netlify
2. On push to `main`, Netlify triggers build
3. Runs `npm run build` or uses `vite`
4. Deploys to `mazid-devops-portfolio.netlify.app`
